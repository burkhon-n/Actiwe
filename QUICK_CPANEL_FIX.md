# Quick cPanel Dependency Fix

## The Problems Solved
1. `pg_config executable not found` (PostgreSQL driver)  
2. `Pillow` compilation errors (image processing)
3. `cryptography` compilation issues (security libraries)

## Solution

### ✅ Updated requirements.txt (Minimal & Compatible)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What was removed/changed:**
- ❌ `psycopg2-binary` → ✅ `asyncpg` (no compilation needed)
- ❌ `Pillow` → ✅ Removed (not used in code)
- ❌ `python-jose[cryptography]` → ✅ Removed (not used)
- ❌ `passlib[bcrypt]` → ✅ Removed (not used)
- ❌ `httpx`, `email-validator`, etc. → ✅ Removed unused deps

**Essential dependencies only:**
- FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, AsyncPG
- Telegram Bot API, Jinja2, Alembic
- Basic Pydantic (no extra compilation)

### Automated Installation
```bash
chmod +x install_deps.sh
./install_deps.sh
```

### Manual Fallback
```bash
# If main requirements fail, try these:
pip install asyncpg==0.29.0
pip install pg8000==1.30.3
```

## What Changed
- **Minimal requirements.txt**: Only essential dependencies, no compilation issues
- **Multi-driver system**: Automatically detects available PostgreSQL drivers
- **Removed unused features**: Image processing, advanced security (not used in current code)

## Result
✅ **Faster installation** - fewer dependencies  
✅ **Better compatibility** - no compilation required  
✅ **Same functionality** - all features still work  
✅ **cPanel ready** - tested and working
